# ü§µ About Me
Hi, I'm Kevin, a Student Development Supervisor and Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I'm on track to complete my undergraduate degree in December 2024, after which I hope to build a successful career centered around the development of great software that provides real value!

Hi, I'm Kevin, an Associate Software Engineer at Southwest Airlines. I recently completed by Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. I center myself around leveraging modern technology to generate real value for people.

# üòç My Passions
I enjoy architecting and building out secure, stable, and scalable software solutions. While the user experience is the most important, software should look good under the hood as well. Although unattainable, I strive for perfection with each project, learning as much as I can along the way.

The sub-fields that stand out to me are Backend Software Engineering, Software Architecture, and ~~DevOps~~ Platform Engineering. I enjoy not only the development of features, but the deployment and operations components of a software solution. I like to straddle the line of the often opposed engineering and operations worlds!

In my free time I enjoy role-playing as a systems administrator and tinkering with enterprise grade system deployments in my homelab. When I need to get outside, I enjoy spending days on the lake wakesurfing and wakeboarding.

# üí™ My Skillset
These days, there are thousands, if not tens-of-thousands of technologies to learn. Choosing where to focus your efforts is often difficult. My repertoire has grown out of some combination of necessity and enthusiasm. Some skills are required for college, while others were developed for personal projects. 

If I had to distill it down, I'd define myself by the following competencies:

I'm always looking for new technologies to add to my toolbelt. Like most techies, trying the "cool new thing" is something I greatly enjoy. Some of the technologies I've been learning lately include:
